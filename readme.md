# Hi there, I'm Adi Triginarsa! 👋

I'm a project manager by day, and a newbie coder by night. I'm currently learning to build AI SaaS web applications, and trust me, it's been one heck of a ride. But hey, who said learning can't be fun, right? 😄


## 🤙 Let's Connect!

Got an idea that's gonna be the next big thing or just wanna chat about whether AI will rule the world? Let's get the ball rolling! You can find me at [mankadi123@gmail.com](mailto:mankadi123@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/triginarsa). I'm always up for a chat, especially if it involves coffee. ☕️
