# Hi there, I'm Adi Triginarsa! 👋

I'm a project manager by day, and a newbie coder by night. I'm currently learning to build AI SaaS web applications, and trust me, it's been one heck of a ride. But hey, who said learning can't be fun, right? 😄

## 🚀 My Journey So Far

- 🏫 From the hallowed halls of Udayana University, I emerged with a Bachelor's degree in IT and an insatiable appetite for coding. My Python loops are tighter than a drum solo, and my machine learning models could predict a cat's mood swing.
- 🌐 At CakepLabs, I've been playing a shepherd in a project for solving a small local community problem. Think of it as a bustling bazaar of 200,000 users that's easier to navigate than your smartphone's settings.
- 🎨 When I'm not breathing life into lines of code, you'll find me in the realm of UX design. My designs are so intuitive, they could probably pass the Turing Test.
- 📚 Currently, I'm on a mission to master the AI SaaS web landscape. They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but hey, I've got coffee and determination on my side.

## 🎖️ Badges? Oh, I've Got a Few!

Certificates in TensorFlow for AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, Sequences, Time Series and Prediction, and Project Management (Scrum Master). I'm like the Boy Scout of coding!

## GitHub Glory 🌟

I've made **37 contributions** in the past year. That's 37 steps closer to becoming the new Tony Stark of coding. Who needs an Arc Reactor when you have a supercharged IDE?

## Fun Fact 🥳

My code is as clean as my sense of humor, which, let's be honest, is a lot cleaner than my room. Remember, a day without a semicolon is like a joke without a punchline.

## 🤙 Let's Connect!

Got an idea that's gonna be the next big thing or just wanna chat about whether AI will rule the world? Let's get the ball rolling! You can find me at [mankadi123@gmail.com](mailto:mankadi123@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/triginarsa). I'm always up for a chat, especially if it involves coffee. ☕️

Thanks for stopping by! And remember, if life gives you bugs, make bug juice. Until then, keep it code-tastic! 🚀
